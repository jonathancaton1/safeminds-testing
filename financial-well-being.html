            *The award is not mandatory – an employee may opt out of receiving the award if they wish.
            HR will arrange the gift voucher and presentation along with the employee’s Line Manager.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-white small">Eligibility</h3>
<p class="text-white small">
  All office employees will be entitled to an award providing they have worked continuously without breaks for Safenames when reaching the milestones outlined above. See exceptions below.
  The Procedure
</p>

<p class="text-white small">A member of HR will liaise with the Line Manager of those reaching 5, 10, 15 and 20 years’ service and notify them in advance of staff eligible to receive an award in that month. The Line Manager will be requested to provide HR with the personal wording to be included in the respective employee’s recognition email signed off by Adan, CEO. (In cases where the Line Manager has not provided the wording to HR by the agreed deadline, this may cause a significant delay in providing the award to the employee.) HR will liaise directly with the employee to arrange their selected award.</p>

<p class="text-white small">Upon reaching the respective milestone, the employee will receive a personalised “cog” and be featured on the office 'Family Tree'. The employee will also receive their gift voucher, on or near the date of their anniversary.</p>

<h3 class="text-white small">Exceptions</h3>
<p class="text-white small">In circumstances where an employee has current disciplinary sanctions against them or is under warning of dismissal, it could be contradictory to reward recognition of service. Under such circumstances, the Line Manager should consult with HR for a decision to defer or withhold the award until such matters are resolved.</p>

<h3 class="text-white small">Legal Implications</h3>
<p class="text-white small">This policy complies with The Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 as the award is designed to encourage and reward loyalty through the presentation of a staff benefit. The policy has been instigated following feedback from staff review groups, employee surveys and our company culture report.</p>

                <p>We have partnered with loveelectric, an independent broker with a mission 
                  to make electric cars accessible and affordable for everyone. And you'll be able to 
                  benefit from their 'lease for less' scheme</p>

                    <h3>What is loveelectric?</h3>
                    <p>LoveElectric's scheme works by allowing you to lease a top-of-the-line electric car within 
                      your salary bracket for a fixed term. And instead of paying for it out of your own pocket, 
                      you'll make a small monthly salary sacrifice, which saves you around 40-50% of your 
                      usual motoring costs through tax and national insurance savings.</p>
  
                      <p>
                        But wait, there's more! This all-inclusive package covers everything from fully 
                        comprehensive car insurance to maintenance and servicing - no deposit or credit check 
                        is required.
                      </p>
  
                      <p>
                        And the best part? There's a wide range of electric cars to choose from, including the 
                        Renault Zoe, VW ID.4, Nissan Leaf, and even Teslas!
                      </p>
