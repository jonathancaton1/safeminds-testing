                        <h2>My Battle with Stress</h2>
                        <h5>- Micah Ogilvie</h5>
                        <br />
                        <p>The day I found out I got the job at Safenames was probably one of the top 10 moments of my life. I had just finished my law degree and was working as a trainee at a law firm.</p>

                            <p>Replacing the mundane desk job with a young and vibrant career in IP was the thing of dreams – I think in my first few months in the job I was already flying off to Paris to negotiate a major contract with one of Europe’s leaders in the casino industry.</p>
                            
                            <p>As you can imagine, with great responsibility comes great stress and for some time I struggled with the pressures that came with the job. Managing all of our legal services single-handedly alongside all the other internal matters really took its toll on my physical and mental health.</p>

                            <p>I remember one day waking up in excruciating pain in my stomach to the point I couldn’t stand – I chalked it off as food poisoning or a stomach bug but when my symptoms lasted for over a week (I hate going to the doctors) I finally decided to go to outpatients where they diagnosed me with IBS caused by stress.</p>
                            <p>
                                I wasn’t too familiar with IBS but I remember the doctor explaining to me that the stomach is like a second brain – you know when you feel nervous and you get butterflies in your
                                stomach – it’s all connected, so when your brain is not right due to things like stress it impacts on other parts of our body like the ‘gut’.
                            </p>
                            
                            <img width="300" class="m-3 rounded float-end" src="images/micah.jpg" />

                            <p>Later that evening I remember going to pick up my prescription at the pharmacy and waiting in the queue. As I approached the counter the pharmacist looked at me in a way I will never forget. She didn’t greet me or smile, just stared at me for what felt like a lifetime. She then asked me: “What do you for a job?”</p>
                            <p>I remember thinking – “what a strange question”.</p>
                            <p>“I manage a legal department” I said.</p>
                            <p>Again, she just stared at me and then said: “you need to quit your job – it’s making you unwell”.</p>
                            <p>That moment hit me hard. Even after the pain in my stomach, going to the doctors, it was only at this point that I realised I was ill – that my stress was now starting to show in my appearance.</p>
                            <p>I was signed off for about a month with stress and I all I can remember is how scared I was going back to work and having to explain my condition to Sam. I needn’t have worried, as Sam was very understanding and proposed that I hire someone to assist me in the department.</p>
                            <p>I wish I could say that I learned from this event but I still continued to struggled to cope with stress.</p>
                            <p>Two years later in 2012 I developed Bell’s Palsy, a condition that causes a paralysis of the muscles on one side of face; the symptoms are similar to a stroke. The scariest thing about the condition is that it can last months, years or even for the rest of your life! Again, this condition was caused by stress and I was signed off for 3 months.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately I made a full recovery, but till this day I still get the pain in the nerves in my face when I ever I get a little bit stressed. I actually appreciate this as it serves as a warning that I need to de-stress or take some time off.</p>
                            <p>I can honestly say I am winning my battle with stress. One of the main things that has helped me is to just have a proper perspective of work and life. I try and not worry about things I have no control over and try not to be anxious over material things.</p>
                            <p>I don’t think stress is a bad thing because it actually drives me to do my best but it definitely needs to be managed properly.</p>
                            <p>At Safenames we always talk about it being a “family”, however you only really appreciate how true that is when you are going through a difficult time.</p>
                            <p>I want others struggling with mental health to open up to their managers or colleagues and you will be surprised how much support is out there.</p>

                        <h5>- David Keay</h5>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I started at Safenames on first September 2020 and after working previously from home for other companies I was pretty used to not seeing human faces every day while I worked.
    When you go to work you take your lunch with you or you buy a sandwich etc and then you get home in the evening and eat a meal- easy. What nobody tells you about when working from home is that the kitchen is available to you full time. Peckish? Hmm bit of cheese on toast hits the spot… mid afternoon hunger pang? I’ll check what’s in the fridge/cupboard well a cheeky fish finger sandwich won’t hurt. You see the picture.
                        </p>

<p>The beginning of 2021 was not good for me I caught salmonella from a duck egg and ended up in hospital for a week while they gave 9.5L of fluid. I then, because of the dehydration developed Gout in both my big toes and my right knee which had me bedridden for a fortnight. I was not in a good way. I couldn’t walk properly, so walked in a different way which then hurt my back, it was an awful time I just never felt well until about June or July and comfort eating I think was a big part of my problem - eating through the pain and the weakness was not a good plan!</p>

<p>So  August 2021 I’ve hit 20 and half stone (131Kg) and I was finding it difficult being alone all day. I became irritable with my family and my outlook on life generally was negative.</p>
<p>So I decided I needed to lose weight and I started to diet but diet alone wasn’t going to help my mental state and so I joined my local gym, but again I knew this wasn’t enough I needed a goal, a treat, a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.</p>

<p>At the age of 15 I Moved to Northampton from Portsmouth, I went to Northampton School for boys to finish My O levels and to do My A levels. I’d played rugby at school in Portsmouth regularly being picked for my school side and when I joined NSB went for try outs and was picked. Walking home from school one day I spotted a poster in a shop window that said “Come and try American Football” I was actually born in the states and hold dual nationality and my older brother had played at high school so I grew up with plenty of “war” stories. So I though why not.. I went along, was good at it and I was hooked and gave up playing Rugby. I played from the age of 15 until I retired at the age of 38. I played In Northampton, Leicester, Chester Milton Keynes  and Bedford.</p> 

<p>So back to my treat, I thought If I can get myself into decent shape AND be competitive then I’d play another season of American Football. My wife said I was crazy but in a good way!</p>

<p>I hooked up with an old pal of mine who had just taken up the job of running the degree course in sports science at Moulton College and asked him to help me out and we started.</p>
<p>We started with a lot of olympic style lifting and oh boy did I feel it. After the first week my legs were raging with lactic acid and I walked like I’d had an unfortunate accident. Mentally I felt better almost immediately I was around other people, talking with my friend about things other than work and he was pushing me to work out - hard. The weight started to drop and I was around the 125Kg by around Oct/November and my target for my squats was to be able to squat my own bodyweight. I managed it 9th December for 2 reps - I was ecstatic!</p> 

<p>Dave pushed me harder and harder and to cut a long, brutal story, short Im now 117kg and still losing weight - I’ve changed my diet to be 99% vegan which seems to give me more energy.</p>
<p>I come back from the gym and feel more alert and ready to face the day mentally as well as physically. I’m now squatting 150kg (23.62 stone) and easily repping 120kg, front squatting 140Kg(22 stone) and Deadlifting 160Kg (25stone). My core is stronger and I’m starting to pack on the all important muscle to play and be competitive. I still have more targets to hit and squatting 170kg is one of them.</p> 

<p>Training sessions with the team have started and I am quite a lot older than a lot of the players (sometimes more than twice as much) but I’m holding my own and feel stronger than I ever have genuinely. Full team training starts Feb 6th and I can honestly say I’m looking forward to it. I think being part of a team with a bunch of people with the usual banter that comes with it is what I have really missed. I know physically I can keep up so I’m looking forward to the season which starts in April 10th with a trip to Hereford. I’ll keep you posted.</p> 

<p>ps. My wife still thinks Im crazy!!</p>
